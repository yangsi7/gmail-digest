## Vocabulary Whitelist

## Evidence Formula

Every achievement follows this pattern:

```
Claim → Evidence → Result (quantified)
```

**Template**:
> "At [Company], I [action], resulting in [metric] vs [benchmark]."

**Example**:
> "At Oxa, I built the Grafana analytics infrastructure that identified stress-relief as our highest-engagement use case. The pivot to stress management resulted in 125% retention improvement."

## Opening Strategies

**Pattern A: Mission Connection**
> "Your mission to [specific goal] resonates with my work [relevant experience]. At [Company], I [achievement]."

**Pattern B: Preemptive Gap**
> "I'll address the experience gap directly: [gap]. What I offer instead is [unique value]."

**Pattern C: Problem-Solution**
> "When [Company] faces [challenge from JD], you need someone who's [solved exact problem]."

**Pattern D: Experience Design**
> "What draws me to this role is [specific challenge]. That complexity is exactly what I spent [time] doing."

---

## Closing Statements

**Strong closings**:
> "I look forward to discussing how my experience in [X] can contribute to [Company's goal]."

> "I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background applies to your priorities."

**Never use**:
- "I would be grateful for the opportunity"
- "Thank you for considering my application"
- "I look forward to hearing from you"
