## Swiss Tone Expectations

| Aspect | Swiss Standard |
|--------|----------------|
| **Formality** | Professional, measured (7-8 out of 10) |
| **Enthusiasm** | Evidence-backed, not gushy |
| **Personality** | Emerges through competence, not explicitly displayed |
| **Confidence** | Confident but not arrogant |
| **Language** | Precise, specific, no fluff |

**Key principle**: Substance over style. Facts over feelings.

## Regional Variations

### German-Speaking (Zurich, Basel, Bern)
- Most formal, structured, fact-driven
- Use bold section headers if applicable
- Avoid emotional appeals, flowery language
- Subjunctive mood signals weakness
- Example: "I successfully implemented [system] which resulted in [metric]."

### French-Speaking (Geneva, Lausanne)
- Professional but slightly warmer
- More expressive language acceptable
- Still evidence-backed, no excessive emotion
- Example: "Building on five years of [achievement], I see an opportunity to bring this approach to [Company]."

### Italian-Speaking (Ticino)
- Slightly more personality acceptable
- Still maintain professional tone
- More visual creativity acceptable
